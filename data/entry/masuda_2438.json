How I got in the ship and was removed from it within one day. - 2020/02/18, kentaro iwataHello. My name is Professor Kentaro Iwata. I am a specialist of infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.Today I entered into[sic]*1 the cruise ship the Diamond Princess, which is, erm, bombarded by a lot of COVID-19 infeciton right now.And I was removed from the ship on the same day and I'm gonna talk to you why this happened. I was very concerned of the number of the people who got infected with the COVID-19 disease infections. Then I was wondering why this is[sic](was)*2 happening. I wanted to enter into the cruise ship and　wanted to be useful in helping to containing infection there. I spoke with several people and finally one officer at working for Ministry of Health and Labor called me yesterday, saying that well you can come and enter into a cruise ship and do the infection control works.And I said fine then I prepared my stuff and I did all the paperworks and arrangement and got onto the Shinkansen from Kobe to Yokohama.On the way to go to Yokohama I got another call from the same officer, saying, \"Somebody didn't like me. So you can't get into the cruise ship.\" He was not able to say who, and he was not able to say why, but certainly some power over him affected his decision and I was blocked from entering into the ship. Then after several discussions he found another way that if you could come as a DMAT member, you can come into the the cruise ship. DMAT is the disaster management medical team in Japan and usually deals with a disaster not infectious diseases, but because of the lack of the people who could help people inside a cruise ship to get out of the ship, or the managing of people, and so on, DMAT was requested to enter into the cruise ship. Because my specialty is not disaster management, so I was not very happy about that, but because we had no other way I said, \"Fine, I'll do that.\" Additionally, I got another call that some people didn't like me getting into the cruise ship present even as a DMAT member. So another discussion happened then the I waited about one hour in Shin Yokohama Station, and finally the officer find a way. [He said] that \"If you work for DMAT not as an infection prevention specialist but as an ordinary routine DMAT officer working under (inaudible01) DMAT doctor doing a routine job, then you could come into the cruise ship.\" I was not very happy with that decision, but because there's no other way, so I said, \"Fine, I'll get into the ship.\" I entered the ship. Then I found the chief officer of the DMAT and spoke with him. I said, \"Well I was assigned to the DMAT members (inaudible02) out whatever you want to say.\" Then he said, \"Well, you don't have to work DMAT work because that's not your specialty. You are an infection prevention specialist, so why don't you do the infection control.\" Then I said, \"Fine, I spoke with the superior of him who is[sic](was) in charge of the all the DMAT operations, and he also said, \"You are an infection control person, so you should do infection control.\" I said, \"Fine.\" But he said, \"Well, you shouldn't be here as a DMAT member. You should come as (inaudible03) infection control specialist.\" He was not very happy about that while I was inside the DMAT. But because that was not my decision, there was no other way. So I said, \"Well I have to do it.\" I looked into the several places inside the ship and it turned out that the cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control.There was no distinction between the Green Zone, which is free of infection, and the Red Zone, which is potentially contaminated by the virus.So the people could come and go, (inaudible04) a PPE, off PPE. Crews were just walking around, the officers of the Ministry Health and Labor were walking around, DMAT people were walking around, psychiatrists were walking around. And people were eating on the one plate. People were wearing PPE and off PPE, and eating lunch with their gloves on, and just dealing with the smartphone with full PPE, so it was completely chaotic.And some crews had a fever. They went to the medical center while wearing N95 masks. But he didn't have any protection between his room and a medical room.And the medical officer was not protecting herself. And she was very unhappy, saying that well she was already infected. I'm sure about that. She was completely giving up protecting herself.Anyways I (have) dealt with a lots of infections (for) more than twenty years. I was in Africa dealing with the Ebola outbreak. I was in another country dealing with the cholera outbreak. I was in China in 2003 to deal with the SARS, and I saw many febrile patients there. I never had fear of getting infection myself for Ebola, SARS, (and) cholera, because I know[sic](knew) how to protect myself and how to protect others, and how the infection control should be. So I could do the adequate infection control; protect myself, and protect others. But inside (the) Princess Diamond, I was so scared. I was so scared of getting COVID-19 because there was no way to tell where the virus is. No Green Zone, no Red Zone. Everywhere could have the virus and everybody was not careful about it.There was no single professional infection control person inside the ship. And there was nobody in charge of infection prevention as a professional. The bureaucrats were in charge of everything. I spoke with the head officer of the Ministry of Health and Labor and he was very unhappy with my suggestion of protecting DMAT people and other staffs so that no other secondary transmission would occur.Then after several hours of talking to people and finding problems, I found a lot of issues there. For example, informed consent of getting a PCR from the people in the ship whereas(? inaudible05) on a paper, and that paper was going back and forth, back and forth with the room of the infection from the paper, by touching there[sic](it). So I suggested that maybe it's better to abandon the paper-type informed consent but rather getting the informed consent verbally would be more protective, and so on and so on.I think I was reasonable. I never yell at anybody, I never criticize anybody personally, but I was trying to be constructive that we try to seek the constructive but immediate improvement to protect everybody inside the ship.※このあたりから、独自に聞き取っておいてから字幕と照らし合わせるという方法に切り替えたので、ことばとことばの間のandなどを書かない頻度が増えます。Then about five o'clock, the person from the quarantine office came in and approaced. (He) said, \"Well you have to be out because you'll not be allowed inside the ship.\" Because I was inside the ship as a temporary officer of the quarantine. Apparently my bank(? inaudible06) was removed by somebody, and nobody said who, and then I was out. The officer who offered me the job of infection control said he was sorry. Then I asked him, \"So what do you wanna do? Do you want to infect everybody in the ship? It will be thousands of people who could potentially get COVID-19.I don't criticize DMAT people. They were infection control specialists. Society of Infection Prevention entered, a lot of specialists came in, but they spent only a few days and they left. And they said they were fearful of getting infections themwelves. I share the same fear. Because I'm in the same room now, and I separated from my family, I'm very scared of getting infection myself and I'm very scared of infecting my family too. I'll be out of my medical services at Kobe University Hospital for maybe next two weeks to avoid further infections to occur. That is very likely to occur if you keep zero infection control inside the ship, the Diamond Princess, like this. You might know that there is no CDC*3 in Japan, but I thought there must be some specialists called on and was[sic](were) in charge of infection control in ship. It's not expecting[sic](expected) (that) nobody was a professional infection control specialist, and (that) only the bureaucrats were doing the jobs, completely layman's work, violatiing all the infection control principles and risking people inside (of*4) further infections, so I'm not very surprised to see many new positive PCR to be broadcasted every day.Hundreds of people got infected and a lot of people from outside Japan decided to take the people away from the ship and bring them to their home countries by airplane and offered them another 14 days of quarantine. I hope this will be an opportunity to raise a question (about) what is happening inside the ship. I wish all the international bodies to request Japan to change. I wish everybody to call for the protection of people inside the Diamond Princess. Otherwise there'll be far more infections for passengers, for crews, for DMAT members, for psychiatrists, for officer(s) of the Ministry of Health and Labor. DMAT members consist of nurses and doctors and that they will go back to the hospital they work routinely and they might infect their patients further to spread the disease. I can't bear with it. I can't bear with it. I think we have to change. We have to do something about these crews and we have to help people inside the ship, their safety and their life. Again, I am Professor Kentaro Iwata, infectious disease specialist. Thank you for listening.【注】＊1: enterは他動詞なので本来はintoは不要。クソリプのような語注だが、英語教材屋なのでそこはすまん。今回は、原文尊重（編集を加えないこと）の観点からそのままintoをつけておくことにした。＊2: 時制の一致でwasにしたほうがよいところ。これ系の文法ミスはほかにもごく少数含まれているが、原文尊重（編集を加えないこと）の観点から、そのまま文字起こしして、より望ましいと思われる語形をカッコで書き添えるようにした。本来、何も書かずにサクッと直すようなところだが、今回は編集者の処理が見えるようにすることが重要と考えた。＊3: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 米国の政府機関。＊4: risk ～ of ... という構文はたぶんないと思うが、書かれた言葉としてはここに何かないと文意が成立しないと思うので、便宜上ofを補っておく。※追記（2月19日午後9時半過ぎ）BBCが岩田教授にインタビューして、日本語記事を英語に先行して出しているので見るとよいと思う。このYouTube動画で説明されていなかった具体的なことも記者との質疑応答で説明されている。映像3分17秒。感染症の専門家、客船内の感染対策を批判 BBCが取材: https://www.bbc.com/japanese/video-51556982",
