How I got in the ship and was removed from it within one day.2020/02/18kentaro iwata00:00hello my name is professor control yatta00:04I am a specialist of infectious diseases00:07at Kobe University Hospital kobe japan00:11today i entered into the guruship00:16diamond princess which is bombarded by a00:21lot of copied 19 infection right now and00:24I was removed from the ship on the same00:27day and I'm gonna talk to you why this00:31happened I was very concerned of the00:34number of the people who got infected00:36with copy 19 disease infections then the00:40I was wondering why this is happening I00:43wanted to enter into the cruise ship and00:46wanted to be useful in helping to00:49containing infection there I spoke with00:53several people and finally the one00:55officer at working for Ministry of00:59Health and Labor called me yesterday01:02saying that well you can come and enter01:04into a cruise ship and do the infection01:06control works and I said fine then I01:08prepared my stuff and II did all the01:12paperwork's and arrangement and they got01:16in onto the Shinkansen from Kobe to01:18Yokohama all the way to go to Yokohama I01:20got another call from the same officer01:21say that somebody didn't like me01:25so do you can't get into the cruise ship01:28the he was not able to say who and he01:32was not able to say why but certainly01:35some power over him01:37affected his decision and I was blocked01:41from entering into the shape then after01:44several discussions he found another way01:46that if you could come as a woman01:48team-up member you can come in at into01:51the cruise ship Jima is the disaster01:53management medical team in Japan and01:55usually deals with disaster not01:58infectious diseases but because of the02:00lack of the people who could help people02:02inside a cruise ship to get out of the02:05ship or the managing of people and the02:08swansong limit was requested to enter in02:12the cruise ship because my specialty is02:16not a disaster management so I was not02:18very happy about that but because we02:20have no other way I said fine I'll do02:22that02:23additionally I got another call that02:26some people didn't like me getting into02:28the cruise ship present even as a team02:30at members ODI another discussion02:33happened then the I rated about our one02:38hour in shin-yokohama sessions and02:40finally the officer find a way that if02:42you work for Team act not as an02:45infection prevention specialist but as02:47the ordinary routine diamond officer02:51working under wounded team at doctor02:53doing a routine job then you could come02:56into the cruise ship I was not very02:59happy with that decision but because03:02there's no other way so I said finding03:04out get into the ship I entered the ship03:07then I found the chief officer of the03:11d-mat and spoke with him I said well I03:15was assigned to the d-mat members or the03:17out whatever you want to say they he03:19said well you don't have to work team at03:22work because that's not your specialty03:23and you are an infection prevention03:26specialist so why don't you do the03:27infection control then I said fine I03:29spoke with the superior of him who is in03:33charge of the ultimate operations and he03:36also said that you are infection control03:38person so you should do infection03:39control I said fine but he said well you03:42shouldn't be here as a d'emic member you03:46should come as the along to infection03:47control specialist he was not very happy03:49about while I was inside a demon but03:54because that was not my decision there03:56was no other way Sophie I said well I03:58have to do it03:59I looked into the several places inside04:03the ship and the turned out that the04:07cruise ship was completely inadequate in04:10terms of the infection control there was04:15no distinction between the Green Zone04:18which is the free of infection and the04:20red zone which is potentially04:22contaminated by Paris so the people04:25could come04:26and go welding a PPE of PPE crews were04:32just walking around and the officers of04:36ministry the house and the labor was04:38walking around d-mat people are walking04:40around psychiatrists are walking around04:42and people were eating on the one04:45players people were wearing PPE and off04:49PPE and eating lunch with a club song04:52and just dealing with the smartphone04:56with full PPE so it was completely04:59chaotic and some crews had a fever they05:06went to the medical center while wearing05:08and nike5 masks but he didn't have any05:11protection between his room and a05:14medical room and the medical officer was05:17not protecting herself and that she was05:20very happy saying that well she was05:24already infected I'm sure about that05:26so the she was completely giving up05:30protecting herself05:32anyways I dealt with a lots of05:36infections more than twenty years and I05:39was in Africa dealing with the Ebola05:41outbreak I was in another country is05:44dealing with the kalila outbreak I was05:48in China in 2003 to deal with the sauce05:52and I saw many febrile patient there I05:55never had fear of getting infection06:00myself for Ebola SARS cholera because I06:07know how to protect myself and how to06:12protect others and how the infection06:15control should be SOT I could do the06:18adequate infection control protect06:21myself and protect others but inside06:24princess diamond I was so scared I was06:29so scared of getting copied 19 because06:33there was no way to tell where the virus06:36is no green zone no red zone06:39everywhere could have Barris and06:41everybody was not careful about it there06:45was no single professional infection06:47control person inside the ship and that06:49there was nobody in charge of infection06:52prevention as a professional the06:53bureaucrats were in charge of everything06:55and I spoke with the head officer of the06:59Ministry of Health on labor and he was07:01very happy with my suggestion of07:04protecting Deemer people and other07:06staffs so that no other secondary07:09transmission to occur then after several07:13hours of talking to people and finding07:16problems I found a lot of issues there07:19for example informed consent of getting07:23a pcr from the people in the ship07:26whereas on a paper and that paper was07:30going back and forth back and forth with07:34the room of the infection from the paper07:36by touching there so I suggested that07:38maybe it's better to abandon the paper07:42type informed consent but resolutely07:44getting the informed consent07:46probably would be more protective so on07:49so on so yeah I I think I was reasonable07:53and I never yell at anybody and I never07:56criticize anybody personally but I was07:59trying to be constructive but we try to08:01seek the constructive but immediate08:05improvement to protect everybody inside08:09the ship then about five o'clock the08:13person from the quarantine of his came08:15in and approached said well you have to08:17be out because you will not be allowed08:20to insert a shape because I was inside08:23ship as the temporary officer of the08:26crown quarantine that he apparently my08:31my bank was removed by somebody and then08:35nobody said who that the I was out and08:39the officer who offered me the job of08:43infection control said he was sorry then08:45I asked him so what do you want to do08:48then do you want to infect everybody in08:49the ship it will be your thousands of08:52people who could08:53potentially get Kovac 19 i don't08:58criticize diamond people they were not09:00infection control specialists Society of09:04infection prevention entered the a lot09:12of specialists came in but they spend09:16only a few days and to left and they09:19said they were fearful of getting09:20infections and cells I share the same09:23fear because I'm in the same room now09:26and I separated from my family I'm very09:31scared of getting infection myself and09:34I'm very scared of infecting my family09:37too I'll be out of my medical services09:41at Culver University Hospital for maybe09:44next two weeks to avoid further09:47infections to occur that is very likely09:51to occur if you keep zero09:55infection control inside the ship that09:58brings us like this you might know that10:02there is no CDC in Japan but I thought10:05there must be some specialists called10:08on and was in charge of infection10:11control in ship it's not expecting10:14nobody was professional infection10:17control specialist and the only the10:21bureaucrats were doing the jobs10:24completely layman's work in the bio10:27letting all the infection control10:29principles and the risking people inside10:33further infections so I'm not very10:36surprised to see many new positive PCR10:41to be broadcasted every day hundreds of10:44people got infected and the lot of10:47people from outside Japan decided to10:49take the people away from the ship and10:53bring them to their home countries by10:56airplane and offered them another 1410:59days of current I I hope this will be11:04the opportunity to11:07raise a question what is happening11:08inside ship I wish all the international11:12bodies to request Japan to change I wish11:16everybody to call for protection of11:23people inside the diamond princess11:26otherwise though we far more infections11:31for passengers for clues for demon11:34members for psychiatrist for officer of11:37the Ministry of Health and labor d-mat11:40member consists of nurses and doctors11:43and that they will go back to the11:44hospital they work routinely and it's a11:47much infected their patients further to11:50spread and the disease11:53I can't bear with it I can't bear with11:56it I think we have to change we have to12:00do something about these crews and we12:05have to help people inside the ship12:08their safety and the life again I am12:15professor can't order an infection this12:18infectious disease specialist thank you12:21for listening ",
