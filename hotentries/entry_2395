So ,   this   is   my   first   time   to   write   Masuda   in   English .   I   am   studying   English   to   take   IELTS   test ,   but   I   don ’ t   know   what   should   I   do   for   the   writing   test .   Is   there   anyone   who   can   check   my   English ?   I   prefer   someone   who   has   taken   IELTS   test   and   got   score   7 . 0   or   more . If   there   is ,   could   you   correct   this   diary ?   I   know   I   write   informal   way ,   but   please   check   the   grammar ,   spelling   and   collocation . I   will   try   to   write   formally   next   time . I   want   to   get   score   8 . 0   over   all   until   2020 .   I ’ m   not   sure   where   I   am ,   ( I   have   never   taken   IELTS )   but   I   think   I   can   get   around   6 . 0   now ...   hopefully . By   the   by ,   I   will   take   General   module ,   not   Academic . Also ,   If   someone   can   give   me   a   study   tip   for   IELTS   ( especially   for   writing   and   speaking ),   that   would   be   great . Thank   you !!!   :)
